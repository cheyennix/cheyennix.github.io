I doubt you've thought this, but I know I have many times in the months since I started this website.<br>The truth is, if you know me you know how hard it is for me to do things and stay consistent with them. I have trouble with severe ADHD and other such neurodivergences/mental illnesses that makes it feel pretty much impossible to stick to long-term projects, and that's why I tried my best to design this website in a way that would be easiest for me to update over time with minimal effort, as a side thing to support whatever it is I created.<br>Unfortunately, I clearly didn't think over the thought side of this website. In the past, I had kept journals of what I did every day, for about a year. At the end of each month of the journal I'd write an overview of that month with more in-depth thoughts about what happened. I figured that this website would be more or less the same - I'd write a new thought about something at least once a month.<br>That's my mistake. What I failed to think about is how those monthly journal thoughts became increasingly smaller until I couldn't fathom the energy to keep doing them. Eventually, I stopped doing the journal all-together.<br>So yeah, this corner of the website is likely going to be pretty dead, but I still want to keep it around. I just need to cut myself some slack, and maybe re-evaluate what it is that should count as being worthy enough to post here. As well as, you know, actually be able to sit down to write them out. Which is harder for me than it should be. Of the three main creative mediums (Art, Music, Writing), I'd say writing comes decently natural to me, and has since I was a kid, but I don't find it particularly enjoyable. Of those, I find music is the most rewarding at this time, but I still have my own sets of struggles with creating music, of course. But anyway, yeah. I don't know how often thoughts will be posted, but I'm going to try to not keep myself tied down to any particular schedule and probably also try to lower my expectations for myself. I don't need to feel bad about failing something else. What? I can move the goal post if I want to, it's my website!<br>tags: <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:thoughts" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#thoughts">#thoughts</a> <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:2024-thoughts" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#2024-thoughts">#2024-thoughts</a>]]></description><link>https://cheyennix.github.io/thoughts/2024/01/02-only-the-second-thought-ever,-and-it's-already-reconsidering-thinking-entirely.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Thoughts/2024/01/02 - Only The Second Thought Ever, And It's Already Reconsidering Thinking Entirely.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[cheyennix]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 17:49:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Very Organized Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:thoughts" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116);

I made this while in a really bad mood and pretty much just focused on it throughout the entire day and made it within that time frame. I think it came out pretty good, honestly. As I say in the description, while making this song I began to envision someone on the verge of life and death - dying and just barely clinging back to life every so often. As they fade farther into death, they hear the voices of angels.<br>The cuckoo clock was inspired by a song that my friend Zoe made, and I thought it would be cool to utilize it as a way to ground the living side of the song to the dead side, alongside the heart monitor that is also heard throughout the song. The iconic 1940's thunder sound (my personal favorite thunder SFX ever) was added for extra feel and also to give the song a sort of Frankenstein vibe to fit with the living-dead sort of dynamic going on. At the end of the song, a final flatline is heard, and fades into an angelic choir.<br>The art was made by me years ago. As I haven't been in much of an art drawing mood, I decided to look and see if anything I had made in the past could work for the song's art, and I landed on that one.<br>The song is in C Major, 120 BPM, 4/4. Pretty standard, right? I decided to include some poly-meters for added variety. The percussion alongside the main beat is in 3/4, and the hi-hats are in 5/4. This means that throughout the song, both get off-sync from the main 4/4 rhythm of the song in different ways, before eventually arriving back in sync.<br>Another fun fact about this song is that the synth part that starts at 2:00 in is actually almost the same as the main synth melody heard throughout the song starts at 0:08. The difference is that it's timing is actually mirrored, and the notes are inverted on the scale.<br><img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/path.png" target="_self"><br>tags: <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:music" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#music">#music</a> <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:2024-music" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#2024-music">#2024-music</a>]]></description><link>https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/01-passage.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Creations/Music/2024/01/01 - passage.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[cheyennix]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 17:33:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/path.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/path.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Musical Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:music" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#music</a> <a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:2024-music" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#2024-music</a> <br> Made this after reading a particularly harrowing post from someone online about their life and past trauma &amp; sins. It made me feel very empathetic towards them and made me a bit existential at the same time. The kind of existential that's less "wow we are so insignificant in the universe" and more "everyone out there is living their own lives with their own completely different experiences and there is no one way to be human. despite this, we often share more similarities than you'd at first realize". this person's life was completely different to my own, yet at the same time had shared a few overarching mentalities towards the world that I had developed completely separately on my own accord for entirely different reasons. something about how the post just sucked me into their life and put me in their shoes for a few hours really stuck with me and I knew I had to write a song about it.<br>musically, it's just C Major 4/4, pretty standard. 108 BPM. this is the first song I've publicly released with vocals in it. hopefully they are fine to listen to. truth be told, releasing this unfortunately stresses me out due to an unhealthy relationship with myself, perfectionism, self-hatred and more, but I figure I need to push myself if I ever want to grow as a person. so rather than letting this rot on my hard drive forever like so many of my other songs, here it is for the world to see. I hope you like it.<br><img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/01_the_magician.png" target="_self"><br>tags: <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:music" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#music">#music</a> <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:2024-music" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#2024-music">#2024-music</a>]]></description><link>https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/02-mara.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Creations/Music/2024/01/02 - mara.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[cheyennix]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 17:31:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/01_the_magician.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/01_the_magician.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
