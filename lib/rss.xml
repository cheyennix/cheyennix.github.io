Turns out tribunic isn't even a word, the closest thing is tribune which is what roman politicians were called.

Location: United States of America<br>Hello, and thank you for your interest. I'm Cheyenne, and I'm terminally online.<br>Starting in 2024, I decided to launch this website. Why? Because why not. I think having a website is cool, and it allows me to express myself in a new way. This website's creation was also inspired by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://skydev.xyz/" rel="noopener" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://skydev.xyz/" target="_self">SkyDev's website</a>. Check out their stuff, I like what they make.<br>If you want to learn more about my interests, check out my favorite things lists below, in no particular order. Just a lot of things that I especially like for one reason or another!<br>tags: <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:about-me" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#about-me">#about-me</a>]]></description><link>https://cheyennix.github.io/about-me/about-me.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">About Me/About Me.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[cheyennix]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 20:11:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cheyennix.github.io/about-me/resources/9.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/about-me/resources/9.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Musical Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:music" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#music</a> <a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:2024-music" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#2024-music</a> <br> Made this after reading a particularly harrowing post from someone I stumbled across online about their life and past trauma &amp; sins. It made me feel very empathetic towards them and made me a bit existential at the same time. The kind of existential that's less "wow we are so insignificant in the universe" and more "everyone out there is living their own lives with their own completely different experiences and there is no one way to be human. despite this, we often share more similarities than you'd at first realize". this person's life was completely different to my own, yet at the same time had shared a few overarching mentalities towards the world that I had developed completely separately on my own accord for entirely different reasons. something about how the post just sucked me into their life and put me in their shoes for a few hours really stuck with me and I knew I had to write a song about it.<br>musically, it's just C Major 4/4, pretty standard. 108 BPM. this is the first song I've publicly released with vocals in it. hopefully they are fine to listen to. truth be told, releasing this unfortunately stresses me out due to an unhealthy relationship with myself, perfectionism, self-hatred and more, but I figure I need to push myself if I ever want to grow as a person. so rather than letting this rot on my hard drive forever like so many of my other songs, here it is for the world to see. I hope you like it.<br><img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/01_the_magician.png" target="_self"><br>tags: <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:music" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#music">#music</a> <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:2024-music" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#2024-music">#2024-music</a>]]></description><link>https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/02-mara.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Creations/Music/2024/01/02 - mara.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[cheyennix]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 17:56:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/01_the_magician.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/01_the_magician.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Artistic Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#art</a> <a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:2024-art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#2024-art</a> <br> <img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/art/2024/01/resources/socks_on.png" target="_self"><br>Date: 01-26-2024<br>I felt like using a different brush again here, and I do like how it came out. It has one of the tropes I keep running into with my art - really weird perspective cartoony hands. Not that I'm complaining, I draw tropes like that because I like them and they make me happy. This individual has some socks on, hence the name. I imagined they were flying somehow with static-electrical build up with these special socks, hence the cyan effects around their feet. The socks are red and blue because of stereotypical magnets, and magnets are, for some reason, somewhat of a strange interest of mine. I just find the process of magnetism fascinating.<br>They have a pretty cool, if a bit ragged sweater on, with an epic face pin. Or maybe it's sewed onto the sweater as well. Who knows? This person is pretty cool, though. The white hair thingies were inspired by Chain Chomps as well as an older art I made, Bezelbub.<br>As for the background, well, I wanted to make a background, but was getting a bit frustrated with it, so I opted for something more abstract instead. Looking back on it now, I feel it probably has too much empty space going on, but it is what it is.<br>tags: <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:art" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#art">#art</a> <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:2024-art" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#2024-art">#2024-art</a>]]></description><link>https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/art/2024/01/05-socks-on.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Creations/Art/2024/01/05 - socks on.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[cheyennix]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 17:50:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/art/2024/01/resources/socks_on.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/art/2024/01/resources/socks_on.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Artistic Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#art</a> <a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:2024-art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#2024-art</a> <br> <img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/art/2024/01/resources/lamb_and_kat.png" target="_self"><br>Date: 01-21-2024<br>Finally, some good fucking food! UmJammer Lammy fan art!<br>Yeah, I like this one - especially the Lammy! I remembered an old piece of art I saw somewhere (or fabricated a memory, not sure) of Lammy with a Nirvana shirt on while drawing this, so I decided to draw her with one. I feel it fits her pretty well. While drawing this, I decided to put on the first Nirvana album, as I've never actually properly listened to Nirvana. It was a fine experience. Not quite my type of stuff, but I am still interested in listening to more in the future. But yeah, it was a good experience drawing this, all things considered. I admit the Katy could probably use some more work, but... come on. Look at the Lammy. She's awesome.

I rarely do vent art, but this is kind of it, I guess, since it was created from frustration and is kind of representative of it as a result. I never posted it anywhere, but it can stay here, since I want to post more of my stuff here. This website is meant to be an outlet for me to better express myself, after-all.<br>But anyway, why was I frustrated, you might wonder? Well, the usual. I often struggle to stay consistent with art of all kinds - I'll have a few days, or maybe a week if I'm lucky, of good days, followed by torturous weeks of a seeming inability to make anything worthwhile. Sometimes I try to force myself anyway. And maybe sometimes it works, but often times, it just leads to more frustration, as I create small things, and subsequently get frustrated at my inability to realize my vision for them or finish them in any greater capacity.

This is one of the results of that. I enjoy the colors. It's named Liftoff because, well, this creature seems to be lifting off from the planet. They're followed by a trail of rainbow dots tracking their every move during this liftoff process. They seem quite content, with their angel wings, halo, and strange geometrical shapes behind them. Illuminated by the same rainbow gradient as their trail, I thought it was a cool effect. The green-blue gradient used for the space is also something I am particularly fond of, bringing it all together, along with the asteroid belt circling the planet in the back, illuminated only with a side of pure white, presumably lit up by the sun, off-screen.<br>Beyond this, I was in a good mood while making this. Maybe the person in the picture represents me. I had and still have big desires for this year. I don't want to stay in my shell anymore; I want to break free and rebirth myself.<br>tags: <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:art" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#art">#art</a> <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:2024-art" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#2024-art">#2024-art</a>]]></description><link>https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/art/2024/01/01-liftoff.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Creations/Art/2024/01/01 - Liftoff.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[cheyennix]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 17:50:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/art/2024/01/resources/liftoff.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/art/2024/01/resources/liftoff.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Great &amp; Powerful Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:thoughts" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#thoughts</a> <a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:2024-thoughts" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#2024-thoughts</a> <br> Date: 05-23-2024<br>Why do I just not post thoughts? I doubt you've thought this, but I know I have many times in the months since I started this website.<br>The truth is, if you know me you know how hard it is for me to do things and stay consistent with them. I have trouble with severe ADHD and other such neurodivergences/mental illnesses that makes it feel pretty much impossible to stick to long-term projects, and that's why I tried my best to design this website in a way that would be easiest for me to update over time with minimal effort, as a side thing to support whatever it is I created.<br>Unfortunately, I clearly didn't think over the thought side of this website. In the past, I had kept journals of what I did every day, for about a year. At the end of each month of the journal I'd write an overview of that month with more in-depth thoughts about what happened. I figured that this website would be more or less the same - I'd write a new thought about something at least once a month.<br>That's my mistake. What I failed to think about is how those monthly journal thoughts became increasingly smaller until I couldn't fathom the energy to keep doing them. Eventually, I stopped doing the journal all-together.<br>So yeah, this corner of the website is likely going to be pretty dead, but I still want to keep it around. I just need to cut myself some slack, and maybe re-evaluate what it is that should count as being worthy enough to post here. As well as, you know, actually be able to sit down to write them out. Which is harder for me than it should be. Of the three main creative mediums (Art, Music, Writing), I'd say writing comes decently natural to me, and has since I was a kid, but I don't find it particularly enjoyable. Of those, I find music is the most rewarding at this time, but I still have my own sets of struggles with creating music, of course. But anyway, yeah. I don't know how often thoughts will be posted, but I'm going to try to not keep myself tied down to any particular schedule and probably also try to lower my expectations for myself. I don't need to feel bad about failing something else. What? I can move the goal post if I want to, it's my website!<br>tags: <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:thoughts" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#thoughts">#thoughts</a> <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:2024-thoughts" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#2024-thoughts">#2024-thoughts</a>]]></description><link>https://cheyennix.github.io/thoughts/2024/01/02-only-the-second-thought-ever,-and-it's-already-reconsidering-thinking-entirely.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Thoughts/2024/01/02 - Only The Second Thought Ever, And It's Already Reconsidering Thinking Entirely.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[cheyennix]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 17:49:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Very Organized Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:thoughts" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116);

I made this while in a really bad mood and pretty much just focused on it throughout the entire day and made it within that time frame. I think it came out pretty good, honestly. As I say in the description, while making this song I began to envision someone on the verge of life and death - dying and just barely clinging back to life every so often. As they fade farther into death, they hear the voices of angels.<br>The cuckoo clock was inspired by a song that my friend Zoe made, and I thought it would be cool to utilize it as a way to ground the living side of the song to the dead side, alongside the heart monitor that is also heard throughout the song. The iconic 1940's thunder sound (my personal favorite thunder SFX ever) was added for extra feel and also to give the song a sort of Frankenstein vibe to fit with the living-dead sort of dynamic going on. At the end of the song, a final flatline is heard, and fades into an angelic choir.<br>The art was made by me years ago. As I haven't been in much of an art drawing mood, I decided to look and see if anything I had made in the past could work for the song's art, and I landed on that one.<br>The song is in C Major, 120 BPM, 4/4. Pretty standard, right? I decided to include some poly-meters for added variety. The percussion alongside the main beat is in 3/4, and the hi-hats are in 5/4. This means that throughout the song, both get off-sync from the main 4/4 rhythm of the song in different ways, before eventually arriving back in sync.<br>Another fun fact about this song is that the synth part that starts at 2:00 in is actually almost the same as the main synth melody heard throughout the song starts at 0:08. The difference is that it's timing is actually mirrored, and the notes are inverted on the scale.<br><img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/path.png" target="_self"><br>tags: <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:music" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#music">#music</a> <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:2024-music" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#2024-music">#2024-music</a>]]></description><link>https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/01-passage.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Creations/Music/2024/01/01 - passage.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[cheyennix]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 17:33:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/path.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cheyennix.github.io/creations/music/2024/01/resources/path.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Shameless Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:support" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#support</a> <br> There's nothing here yet.

It's perfect mid-late-2000s internet dance pop aesthetic that I for some reason am enamored with, having grown up on the internet around that time. I personally have some limited nostalgia for the song. I didn't think about it for years, and forgot it existed entirely, until I heard it again in a random playlist on YouTube that I was listening to while drawing. And I was immediately filled with inspiration soon after.<br>I drew this over the course of maybe an hour and a half, and the entire time, Psycho Teddy was blaring in my headphones. Needless to say, I might have overdosed on the song on that night. By the time I finished the drawing, I just immediately curled over and went to bed.<br>Oh yeah... I was supposed to talk about the art itself. Well, there's not that much to it. I really like how it came out, actually, and want to try out this brush more in the future. Her shirt originally had a Psycho Teddy on it, but I wasn't that happy with how it came out, and it felt a bit too referential with it, so I decided to go with those weird geometrical things instead. If you notice, I snuck a little patch on her arm, near her shoulder. What's that? An HRT patch? It sure is.

To make a long story short, I'm just someone who likes to create things, and is slowly but surely trying to find their place in the world, as well as survive it at the same time. I decided to make this website in late 2023 for a multitude of reasons. I'll talk about them a bit in this post.<br>To begin, I wanted 2024 to be a year of improvement. Coming off of 2023, it contained probably the biggest steps forward in my life in recent years. After suspecting myself of having ADHD for over a year, I finally was able to be diagnosed and start medication for it. While this didn't totally fix my ADHD, which is very severe, it did help immensely in a lot of ways. I struggle with many mental health issues, and have ever since I was a kid. I didn't have a great childhood at all, which I might delve more into some day, but it's a bit beyond the scope of this initial post.<br>Anyway, after a few years of pushing parts of myself behind me, I told myself that 2024 was the year that I was done hiding my true self, both from myself and others, throughout most every facet of my life. In recent years I've always been an advocate of such a thing, but I never fully followed my own advice - probably out of insecurity, despite my best attempts. I told myself that in 2024, all of that is over for real. No more hiding from who I am, and what I like. No more hiding that from other people, either. I'm simply me, and I want to enjoy my time on this earth. I don't want to be a shut-in anymore. I don't want to stay mostly miserable.<br>2024 is the year of the start of my rebirth as a person, or at least that's how I like to imagine it. A few days into 2024, I got really bad Covid, and as of the time of writing this, on February 7th, 2024, it's still fucking me up. Thankfully, most of my symptoms have went away by now - but I'm still dealing with shortness of breath, coughing, and messed up taste buds. Which all really suck, especially with the situation I'm in right now.<br>Anyway, that's a bit off-topic. The point is, I thought a website would be a cool way to help facilitate that rebirth. To connect with not only myself, but others as well, by writing and reflecting on things - whether they be my thoughts on something important, someone else's creation, my own creations, or whatever else I want to put on this website down the line. Essentially, having my own little space just sounds good. My own little corner of the internet. And, being honest, I live on the Internet... so I want a place of my own on here, too.<br>I hate how centralized and uniform everything has become online. I miss the days of forums and communities where people knew each-other. I miss the days of people having their own websites, and putting so much of themselves out there. I miss the days before people internalized a sense of shame for being "too out-there". People nowadays always say "be yourself" - but all too often, that just means "be yourself, until it's too weird for us". No. Fuck that. Cringe culture is said to be dead, but it's remnants are deeply rooted into us, and the online world is no exception.<br>There's a larger cultural trend of a general lack of sincerity these days. Whether it be from our popular media, our celebrities, or whatever else. And I can't stand it. And I refuse it. I want to be one of the people who push against that. And making a website is just one thing I can do to help that. I'm inspired by others who've made their own websites, who still use forums, and have formed communities, even in the era of the over-monetized, sanitized Internet.<br>The Internet used to be a place of perpetual self-expression. And it was beautiful. That's why it grew so big, and that's why so many people were more happy with it back then. But along the way, it's slowly become corrupted, and corporatized, like most of our society has these days. Which is, needless to say, absolutely terrible, and ruining people's lives and sense of self.<br>If you want to read more, and learn more about what made me seriously consider creating my own website, I recommend that you check out these posts here: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://thoughts.melonking.net/guides/introduction-to-the-web-revival-1-what-is-the-web-revival" rel="noopener" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://thoughts.melonking.net/guides/introduction-to-the-web-revival-1-what-is-the-web-revival" target="_self">What is the Web Revival?</a><br>I've probably forgotten some stuff I wanted to write about here, but there will be plenty of time for that later. I can't promise a consistent schedule for these thoughts, but I'll try to write them whenever I feel inspired to talk about something, whatever that may be.<br>P.S. - I realize the way I come off here can be misconstrued as if I'm some sort of personal freedoms hero, or something. That's not how I want to come off, don't get me wrong. I understand that me making a website isn't some sort of grand statement. And in all actuality, very, very few people will even visit this website, let alone read this. But, like I said - this isn't only about other people. That's a sort of modern Internet, social media mindset. That creations are dominantly made for others. If you want to live that way, go ahead. I myself try to have a healthy balance of making art for myself first and foremost, and then the joy of sharing that creation with others afterwards. But there absolutely is something to be said about the general loss of perception of creations coming from individuals, and the concept that creations that are first and foremost made for the creators themselves, which is how it has been for all of human history. But now, many things are very monetized - creations are all too often spawned not from passion and love, but the need to create it for profit. Maybe sometimes they still turn out good. But I believe this trend in general is extremely harmful to the human experience.<br>And remember - the terms artist, creator, musician, director - whatever else; these aren't special, coveted titles that are reserved for special people with perceived talents and innate skills. These are things that everyone can be. Everyone can create anything, and other people will absolutely resonate with it. It doesn't matter what you think your skill level is. Don't be the person that I've been for all too long now. Don't be the person who makes things and never shares the vast majority of them with the world because they "aren't good enough". It's a hard hurdle to clear, but you have to at least try. To push yourself out there.<br>I don't claim to be perfect in this regard at all. I feel like I struggle with this to an insane amount. Even now, when I'm actively trying to fight against it, it's hard. Sometimes it's out of embarrassment that I don't share things. Sometimes it's because I have such strict standards for myself. And, to be clear, I'm not saying to share stuff you aren't comfortable with sharing. It's not so black-and-white like that. But rather, I say that I think we should all really ask ourselves if we should be ashamed of what we create, and/or who you are.<br>The answer is pretty much always a resounding no. I believe that one way we can change our world and our future for the better, as well as our larger collective attitude towards... well, everything, is to first accept ourselves. Then we can better understand everyone else.<br>That's how I envision a better tomorrow being created. That's what I'd like to see in the world.<br>tags: <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:thoughts" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#thoughts">#thoughts</a> <a href="https://cheyennix.github.io?query=tag:2024-thoughts" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-href="#2024-thoughts">#2024-thoughts</a>]]></description><link>https://cheyennix.github.io/thoughts/2024/01/01-the-first-ever-thought-in-the-history-of-humanity.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Thoughts/2024/01/01 - The First Ever Thought In The History Of Humanity.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[cheyennix]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 00:49:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Thoughtful Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://cheyennix.github.io/?query=tag:thoughts" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#thoughts</a> <br> This is where I'll write random stuff... maybe... sometimes.<br>
