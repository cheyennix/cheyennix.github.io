Welcome to my website. I'm Cheyenne.<br>On this website, I plan to post random <a class="internal-link" data-href="Thoughts/Thoughts.md" href="\thoughts\thoughts.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thoughts</a>, post about my own <a class="internal-link" data-href="Creations/Creations.md" href="\creations\creations.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Creations</a>, and general stuff like that. Maybe you care because you like taking a look into some other person's life. Maybe you don't care at all. Either is fine. Thank you for being here regardless.<br>Currently, the site is WIP, but I plan to flesh it out over time with various things.<br>The theming of the website is provided by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/deathau/80s-Neon-for-Obsidian.md" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/deathau/80s-Neon-for-Obsidian.md" target="_blank">deathau</a>. It's a theme for Obsidian, a markdown text editor that's pretty cool. The files of this site exist as markdown files on my hard-drive, but are converted into HTML via a plugin for Obsidian created by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export" target="_blank">KosmosisDesire</a>, which also converts the theme mentioned above into HTML.<br>Thanks to Obsidian &amp; the HTML conversion script:<br>

I think having a website is cool, and it allows me to express myself in a new way.

 <br><br><br><br><br><img src="\creations\art\2024\01\resources\liftoff.png"><br><br>Date: 01-04-2024<br>Around the end of 2023, I decided to try to use more pixel-art brushes, notably flipnote-styled brushes. This is one of the results of that. I enjoy the colors. It's named Liftoff because, well, this creature seems to be lifting off from the planet. They're followed by a trail of rainbow dots tracking their every move during this liftoff process. They seem quite content, with their angel wings, halo, and strange geometrical shapes behind them. Illuminated by the same rainbow gradient as their trail, I thought it was a cool effect. The green-blue gradient used for the space is also something I am particularly fond of, bringing it all together, along with the asteroid belt circling the planet in the back, illuminated only with a side of pure white, presumably lit up by the sun, off-screen.<br>Beyond this, I was in a good mood while making this. Maybe the person in the picture represents me. I had and still have big desires for this year. I don't want to stay in my shell anymore; I want to break free and rebirth myself.<br><br>tags: <a href=".?query=tag:art" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#art</a> <a href=".?query=tag:2024-art" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#2024-art</a>]]></description><link>creations\art\2024\01\01-liftoff.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Creations/Art/2024/01/01 - Liftoff.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 20:57:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="creations\art\2024\01\resources\liftoff.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="creations\art\2024\01\resources\liftoff.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Artistic Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#art</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:2024-art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#2024-art</a> 
 <br><br><br><br><br><img src="\creations\art\2024\01\resources\burned.png"><br><br>Date: 01-18-2024<br>In a contrast to the first art of the year, there's this. While <a class="internal-link" data-href="Creations/Art/2024/01/01 - Liftoff.md" href="\creations\art\2024\01\01-liftoff.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Liftoff</a> was created while I was in a happy mood, I created BURNED while really not feeling good. I rarely do vent art, but this is kind of it, I guess, since it was created from frustration and is kind of representative of it as a result. I never posted it anywhere, but it can stay here, since I want to post more of my stuff here. This website is meant to be an outlet for me to better express myself, after-all.<br>But anyway, why was I frustrated, you might wonder? Well, the usual. I often struggle to stay consistent with art of all kinds - I'll have a few days, or maybe a week if I'm lucky, of good days, followed by torturous weeks of a seeming inability to make anything worthwhile. Sometimes I try to force myself anyway. And maybe sometimes it works, but often times, it just leads to more frustration, as I create small things, and subsequently get frustrated at my inability to realize my vision for them or finish them in any greater capacity. ADHD for the win!<br><br>tags: <a href=".?query=tag:art" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#art</a> <a href=".?query=tag:2024-art" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#2024-art</a>]]></description><link>creations\art\2024\01\02-burned.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Creations/Art/2024/01/02 - BURNED.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 20:57:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="creations\art\2024\01\resources\burned.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="creations\art\2024\01\resources\burned.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Artistic Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#art</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:2024-art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#2024-art</a>

UmJammer Lammy fan art!<br>Yeah, I like this one - especially the Lammy! I remembered an old piece of art I saw somewhere (or fabricated a memory, not sure) of Lammy with a Nirvana shirt on while drawing this, so I decided to draw her with one. I feel it fits her pretty well. While drawing this, I decided to put on the first Nirvana album, as I've never actually properly listened to Nirvana. It was a fine experience. Not quite my type of stuff, but I am still interested in listening to more in the future. But yeah, it was a good experience drawing this, all things considered. I admit the Katy could probably use some more work, but... come on. Look at the Lammy. She's awesome. I don't know how I drew that. :P<br><br>tags: <a href=".?query=tag:art" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#art</a> <a href=".?query=tag:2024-art" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#2024-art</a>]]></description><link>creations\art\2024\01\04-lamb-and-kat.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Creations/Art/2024/01/04 - lamb and kat.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 20:57:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="creations\art\2024\01\resources\lamb_and_kat.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="creations\art\2024\01\resources\lamb_and_kat.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Artistic Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#art</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:2024-art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#2024-art</a> 
 <br><br><br><br><br><img src="\creations\art\2024\01\resources\socks_on.png"><br><br>Date: 01-26-2024<br>I felt like using a different brush again here, and I do like how it came out. It has one of the tropes I keep running into with my art - really weird perspective cartoony hands. Not that I'm complaining, I draw tropes like that because I like them and they make me happy. This individual has some socks on, hence the name. I imagined they were flying somehow with static-electrical build up with these special socks, hence the cyan effects around their feet. The socks are red and blue because of stereotypical magnets, and magnets are, for some reason, somewhat of a strange interest of mine. I just find the process of magnetism fascinating.<br>They have a pretty cool, if a bit ragged sweater on, with an epic face pin. Or maybe it's sewed onto the sweater as well. Who knows? This person is pretty cool, though. The white hair thingies were inspired by Chain Chomps as well as an older art I made, Bezelbub.<br>As for the background, well, I wanted to make a background, but was getting a bit frustrated with it, so I opted for something more abstract instead. Looking back on it now, I feel it probably has too much empty space going on, but it is what it is.<br><br>tags: <a href=".?query=tag:art" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#art</a> <a href=".?query=tag:2024-art" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#2024-art</a>]]></description><link>creations\art\2024\01\05-socks-on.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Creations/Art/2024/01/05 - socks on.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 20:57:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="creations\art\2024\01\resources\socks_on.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="creations\art\2024\01\resources\socks_on.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Artistic Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#art</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:2024-art" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#2024-art</a>

The title, and the text within the art, is a reference to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlbdHKrLOo" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlbdHKrLOo" target="_blank">Psycho Teddy</a> - if you've never heard the song before, well... just be prepared to kill the part of you that cringes (as you should for all things). It's perfect mid-late-2000s internet dance pop aesthetic that I for some reason am enamored with, having grown up on the internet around that time. I personally have some limited nostalgia for the song. I didn't think about it for years, and forgot it existed entirely, until I heard it again in a random playlist on YouTube that I was listening to while drawing. And I was immediately filled with inspiration soon after.<br>I drew this over the course of maybe an hour and a half, and the entire time, Psycho Teddy was blaring in my headphones. Needless to say, I might have overdosed on the song on that night. By the time I finished the drawing, I just immediately curled over and went to bed.<br>Oh yeah... I was supposed to talk about the art itself. Well, there's not that much to it. I really like how it came out, actually, and want to try out this brush more in the future. Her shirt originally had a Psycho Teddy on it, but I wasn't that happy with how it came out, and it felt a bit too referential with it, so I decided to go with those weird geometrical things instead. If you notice, I snuck a little patch on her arm, near her shoulder. What's that? An HRT patch? It sure is.

 <br><br><br><br><br>Date: 02-07-2024<br>I'm Cheyenne, and you can learn more about me on my <a class="internal-link" data-href="About Me/About Me.md" href="\about-me\about-me.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">About Me</a> page. To make a long story short, I'm just someone who likes to create things, and is slowly but surely trying to find their place in the world, as well as survive it at the same time. I decided to make this website in late 2023 for a multitude of reasons. I'll talk about them a bit in this post.<br>To begin, I wanted 2024 to be a year of improvement. Coming off of 2023, it contained probably the biggest steps forward in my life in recent years. After suspecting myself of having ADHD for over a year, I finally was able to be diagnosed and start medication for it. While this didn't totally fix my ADHD, which is very severe, it did help immensely in a lot of ways. I struggle with many mental health issues, and have ever since I was a kid. I didn't have a great childhood at all, which I might delve more into some day, but it's a bit beyond the scope of this initial post.<br>Anyway, after a few years of pushing parts of myself behind me, I told myself that 2024 was the year that I was done hiding my true self, both from myself and others, throughout most every facet of my life. In recent years I've always been an advocate of such a thing, but I never fully followed my own advice - probably out of insecurity, despite my best attempts. I told myself that in 2024, all of that is over for real. No more hiding from who I am, and what I like. No more hiding that from other people, either. I'm simply me, and I want to enjoy my time on this earth. I don't want to be a shut-in anymore. I don't want to stay mostly miserable.<br>2024 is the year of the start of my rebirth as a person, or at least that's how I like to imagine it. A few days into 2024, I got really bad Covid, and as of the time of writing this, on February 7th, 2024, it's still fucking me up. Thankfully, most of my symptoms have went away by now - but I'm still dealing with shortness of breath, coughing, and messed up taste buds. Which all really suck, especially with the situation I'm in right now.<br>Anyway, that's a bit off-topic. The point is, I thought a website would be a cool way to help facilitate that rebirth. To connect with not only myself, but others as well, by writing and reflecting on things - whether they be my thoughts on something important, someone else's creation, my own creations, or whatever else I want to put on this website down the line. Essentially, having my own little space just sounds good. My own little corner of the internet. And, being honest, I live on the Internet... so I want a place of my own on here, too.<br>I hate how centralized and uniform everything has become online. I miss the days of forums and communities where people knew each-other. I miss the days of people having their own websites, and putting so much of themselves out there. I miss the days before people internalized a sense of shame for being "too out-there". People nowadays always say "be yourself" - but all too often, that just means "be yourself, until it's too weird for us". No. Fuck that. Cringe culture is said to be dead, but it's remnants are deeply rooted into us, and the online world is no exception.<br>There's a larger cultural trend of a general lack of sincerity these days. Whether it be from our popular media, our celebrities, or whatever else. And I can't stand it. And I refuse it. I want to be one of the people who push against that. And making a website is just one thing I can do to help that. I'm inspired by others who've made their own websites, who still use forums, and have formed communities, even in the era of the over-monetized, sanitized Internet.<br>The Internet used to be a place of perpetual self-expression. And it was beautiful. That's why it grew so big, and that's why so many people were more happy with it back then. But along the way, it's slowly become corrupted, and corporatized, like most of our society has these days. Which is, needless to say, absolutely terrible, and ruining people's lives and sense of self.<br>If you want to read more, and learn more about what made me seriously consider creating my own website, I recommend that you check out these posts here: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://thoughts.melonking.net/guides/introduction-to-the-web-revival-1-what-is-the-web-revival" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://thoughts.melonking.net/guides/introduction-to-the-web-revival-1-what-is-the-web-revival" target="_blank">What is the Web Revival?</a><br>I've probably forgotten some stuff I wanted to write about here, but there will be plenty of time for that later. I can't promise a consistent schedule for these thoughts, but I'll try to write them whenever I feel inspired to talk about something, whatever that may be.<br><br>P.S. - I realize the way I come off here can be misconstrued as if I'm some sort of personal freedoms hero, or something. That's not how I want to come off, don't get me wrong. I understand that me making a website isn't some sort of grand statement. And in all actuality, very, very few people will even visit this website, let alone read this. But, like I said - this isn't only about other people. That's a sort of modern Internet, social media mindset. That creations are dominantly made for others. If you want to live that way, go ahead. I myself try to have a healthy balance of making art for myself first and foremost, and then the joy of sharing that creation with others afterwards. But there absolutely is something to be said about the general loss of perception of creations coming from individuals, and the concept that creations that are first and foremost made for the creators themselves, which is how it has been for all of human history. But now, many things are very monetized - creations are all too often spawned not from passion and love, but the need to create it for profit. Maybe sometimes they still turn out good. But I believe this trend in general is extremely harmful to the human experience.<br>And remember - the terms artist, creator, musician, director - whatever else; these aren't special, coveted titles that are reserved for special people with perceived talents and innate skills. These are things that everyone can be. Everyone can create anything, and other people will absolutely resonate with it. It doesn't matter what you think your skill level is. Don't be the person that I've been for all too long now. Don't be the person who makes things and never shares the vast majority of them with the world because they "aren't good enough". It's a hard hurdle to clear, but you have to at least try. To push yourself out there.<br>I don't claim to be perfect in this regard at all. I feel like I struggle with this to an insane amount. Even now, when I'm actively trying to fight against it, it's hard. Sometimes it's out of embarrassment that I don't share things. Sometimes it's because I have such strict standards for myself. And, to be clear, I'm not saying to share stuff you aren't comfortable with sharing. It's not so black-and-white like that. But rather, I say that I think we should all really ask ourselves if we should be ashamed of what we create, and/or who you are.<br>The answer is pretty much always a resounding no. I believe that one way we can change our world and our future for the better, as well as our larger collective attitude towards... well, everything, is to first accept ourselves. Then we can better understand everyone else.<br>That's how I envision a better tomorrow being created. That's what I'd like to see in the world.<br><br>tags: <a href=".?query=tag:thoughts" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#thoughts</a> <a href=".?query=tag:2024-thoughts" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#2024-thoughts</a> ]]></description><link>thoughts\2024\01\01-the-first-ever-thought-in-the-history-of-humanity.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Thoughts/2024/01/01 - The First Ever Thought In The History Of Humanity.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 01:02:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Very Organized Website of Cheyenne]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:thoughts" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#thoughts</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:2024-thoughts" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#2024-thoughts</a>
